              There are several estimators of kinship that make use of dense

              existing estimators are special cases. Within this class, we
              derive properties of the estimators and determine an optimal
              estimator. Additionally, we introduce an alternative marker

              estimators. In a simulation study, we show that improved

              reduced power. We propose a method, ROADTRIPS, for case-control
              association testing in samples with partially or completely
              unknown population and pedigree structure. ROADTRIPS uses a
              covariance matrix estimated from genome-screen data to correct
              for unknown population and pedigree structure while maintaining
              high power by taking advantage of known pedigree information when
              it is available. ROADTRIPS can incorporate data on arbitrary

              millions of markers. In simulations with related individuals and

              methods in terms of power and type 1 error. The ROADTRIPS method
              can be used across a variety of study designs, ranging from

Motivated by the failure of LMMs to control type I errors in a GWAS of asthma, a binary trait, we show that LMMs are generally inappropriate for analyzing binary traits when population stratification leads to violation of the LMM's constant-residual variance assumption. To overcome this problem, we develop a computationally efficient logistic mixed model approach for genome-wide analysis of binary traits, the generalized linear mixed model association test (GMMAT). This approach fits a logistic mixed model once per GWAS and performs score tests under the null hypothesis of no association between a binary trait and individual genetic variants. We show in simulation studies and real data analysis that GMMAT effectively controls for population structure and relatedness when analyzing binary traits in a wide variety of study designs.},

	abstract = {The study of continuously varying, quantitative traits is important in evolutionary biology, agriculture, and medicine. Variation in such traits is attributable to many, possibly interacting, genes whose expression may be sensitive to the environment, which makes their dissection into underlying causative factors difficult. An important population parameter for quantitative traits is heritability, the proportion of total variance that is due to genetic factors. Response to artificial and natural selection and the degree of resemblance between relatives are all a function of this parameter. Following the classic paper by R. A. Fisher in 1918, the estimation of additive and dominance genetic variance and heritability in populations is based upon the expected proportion of genes shared between different types of relatives, and explicit, often controversial and untestable models of genetic and non-genetic causes of family resemblance. With genome-wide coverage of genetic markers it is now possible to estimate such parameters solely within families using the actual degree of identity-by-descent sharing between relatives. Using genome scans on 4,401 quasi-independent sib pairs of which 3,375 pairs had phenotypes, we estimated the heritability of height from empirical genome-wide identity-by-descent sharing, which varied from 0.374 to 0.617 (mean 0.498, standard deviation 0.036). The variance in identity-by-descent sharing per chromosome and per genome was consistent with theory. The maximum likelihood estimate of the heritability for height was 0.80 with no evidence for non-genetic causes of sib resemblance, consistent with results from independent twin and family studies but using an entirely separate source of information. Our application shows that it is feasible to estimate genetic variance solely from within-family segregation and provides an independent validation of previously untestable assumptions. Given sufficient data, our new paradigm will allow the estimation of genetic variation for disease susceptibility and quantitative traits that is free from confounding with non-genetic factors and will allow partitioning of genetic variation into additive and non-additive components.},

@article{ukin,
	abstract = {Accurate estimate of relatedness is important for genetic data analyses, such as heritability estimation and association mapping based on data collected from genome-wide association studies. Inaccurate relatedness estimates may lead to biased heritability estimations and spurious associations. Individual-level genotype data are often used to estimate kinship coefficient between individuals. The commonly used sample correlation-based genomic relationship matrix (scGRM) method estimates kinship coefficient by calculating the average sample correlation coefficient among all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), where the observed allele frequencies are used to calculate both the expectations and variances of genotypes. Although this method is widely used, a substantial proportion of estimated kinship coefficients are negative, which are difficult to interpret. In this paper, through mathematical derivation, we show that there indeed exists bias in the estimated kinship coefficient using the scGRM method when the observed allele frequencies are regarded as true frequencies. This leads to negative bias for the average estimate of kinship among all individuals, which explains the estimated negative kinship coefficients. Based on this observation, we propose an unbiased estimation method, UKin, which can reduce kinship estimation bias. We justify our improved method with rigorous mathematical proof. We have conducted simulations as well as two real data analyses to compare UKin with scGRM and three other kinship estimating methods: rGRM, tsGRM, and KING. Our results demonstrate that both bias and root mean square error in kinship coefficient estimation could be reduced by using UKin. We further investigated the performance of UKin, KING, and three GRM-based methods in calculating the SNP-based heritability, and show that UKin can improve estimation accuracy for heritability regardless of the scale of SNP panel.},

  abstract = "Genomic inversions are an increasingly recognized source of
              genetic variation. However, a lack of reliable high-throughput
              genotyping assays for these structures has precluded a full
              understanding of an inversion's phylogenetic, phenotypic, and
              population genetic properties. We characterize these properties
              for one of the largest polymorphic inversions in man (the ∼4.5-Mb
              8p23.1 inversion), a structure that encompasses numerous signals
              of natural selection and disease association. We developed and
              validated a flexible bioinformatics tool that utilizes SNP data
              to enable accurate, high-throughput genotyping of the 8p23.1
              inversion. This tool was applied retrospectively to diverse
              genome-wide data sets, revealing significant population
              stratification that largely follows a clinal ``serial founder
              effect'' distribution model. Phylogenetic analyses establish the
              inversion's ancestral origin within the Homo lineage, indicating
              that 8p23.1 inversion has occurred independently in the Pan
              lineage. The human inversion breakpoint was localized to an
              inverted pair of human endogenous retrovirus elements within the
              large, flanking low-copy repeats; experimental validation of this
              breakpoint confirmed these elements as the likely intermediary
              substrates that sponsored inversion formation. In five data sets,
              mRNA levels of disease-associated genes were robustly associated
              with inversion genotype. Moreover, a haplotype associated with
              systemic lupus erythematosus was restricted to the derived
              inversion state. We conclude that the 8p23.1 inversion is an
              evolutionarily dynamic structure that can now be accommodated
              into the understanding of human genetic and phenotypic diversity.",
